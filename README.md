# Bitcoin Mining (SHA256) Hash Algorithm

ECE 111 Final Project

Implement and optimize a SHA256 hash algorithm such that every file can be compressed into 256-bit hash value. 

Secure Hash Algorithm

• Goal is to compute a unique hash value for any input
“message”, where a “message” can be anything.

• SHA-256 (widely used) returns a 256-bit hash value (a.k.a.
message digest or strong checksum)

My job in this project:
1. Designed and implemented an efficient Bitcoin Hashing SHA256 algorithm

2. Implemented pipelining and unfolding computation for SHA256. Improved performance for Bitcoin mining to a theoretical maximum value

3. Languages\&Frameworks used: SystemVerilog, C, Quartus, ModelSim
